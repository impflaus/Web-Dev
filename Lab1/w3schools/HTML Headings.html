<!-- Headings Are Important
Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.

Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure.

<h1> headings should be used for main headings, followed by <h2> headings, then the less important <h3>, and so on.

For example:

<h1> - Page title
<h2> - Section titles
<h3> - Sub-sections
-->

<h1>Travel Guide</h1>

<h2>Europe</h2>
<h3>France</h3>
<h3>Italy</h3>

<h2>Asia</h2>
<h3>India</h3>
<h3>Thailand</h3>

<!-- Bigger Headings
Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute,
using the CSS font-size property:

<h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1>

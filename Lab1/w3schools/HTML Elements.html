<!-- HTML Elements
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>

Examples of some HTML elements:

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
-->

<!-- Nested HTML Elements
HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).

All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.

The following example contains four HTML elements (<html>, <body>, <h1> and <p>):
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>

        <h1>My First Heading</h1>
        <p>My first paragraph.</p>
    </body>
</html>

<!-- Empty HTML Elements
HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.

The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:

    <p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>
-->
